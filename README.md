# Invaders

Invaders is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player controls a starship by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending enemies. The aim is to defeat three rows of eleven enemies that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance toward the bottom of the screen. The player defeats an enemy, and earns points, by shooting it with the starship's laser cannons. Defeating the enemies brings another wave that is more difficult, with faster movement and a higher fire rate, a loop which continues for 10 levels.

The enemies attempt to destroy the player's starship by firing at it while they approach the bottom of the screen. If they reach the bottom or damage the player's starship three times, the invasion is successful and the game ends. The starship is partially protected by several stationary defense ships that are gradually destroyed by numerous blasts from the enemies.
